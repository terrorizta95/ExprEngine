%J  Imaginary unit.
%   As the basic imaginary unit SQRT(-1), i and j are used to enter
%   complex numbers.  For example, the expressions 3+2i, 3+2*i, 3+2j,
%   3+2*j and 3+2*sqrt(-1) all have the same value.
%
%   Since both i and j are functions, they can be overridden and used
%   as a variable.  This permits you to use i or j as an index in FOR
%   loops, subscripts, etc.
